DESCRIPTION
	Possible instructions are:

	help
		displays this help.

	exit
		exits the debugger.

	ls-macro-code [NUM1 [NUM2]]
		Prints the assembler code to the user, trying to disassemble it.
		If parameters are omitted, then the whole code will be printed to the user.
		If only NUM1 is given, then NUM1 lines of code before and after the current
		assembler instruction will be printed.
		If also NUM2 is given, NUM1 is a number referring the first line to print
		and NUM2 the number of the last line to print. Lines are numbered according
		to the output of this function without parameters.

	ls-reg [REG]
		Lists the value of a register, where REG is the name of that register.
		If REG is omitted then the values of all registers are listed.

	run
		runs the program until its end or until a breakpoint is hit.

	set REG VAL
		Sets REG's value to VAL. Where REG is the name of a register and VAL the
		new value for that register.

	set-mem ADDR VAL
		Sets the value of the main memory at the address ADDR. Where VAL is the new
		value to store at that address.

	step [NUM]
		Executes NUM instructions, where NUM is a natural number. If NUM is omitted
		then one instruction will be executed.
		The processor executes only instructions until the halt-instruction is found.

	trace-mic
		Traces the executed micro instructions.

	untrace-mic
		Ends tracing the executed micro instructions.

	trace-reg [REG]
		Traces the value of a register after each instruction, where REG is the name
		of that register. If REG is omitted then all registers are traced.

	untrace-reg [REG]
		Ends tracing the value of a register after each instruction, where REG is
		the name of that register. If REG is omitted then this ends tracing all
		registers.
