DESCRIPTION
	Possible instructions are:

	help
		displays this help.

	exit
		exits the debugger.

	ls-reg [REG]
		Lists the value of a register, where REG is the name of that register.
		If REG is omitted then the values of all registers are listed.

	run
		runs the program until its end or until a breakpoint is hit.

	step [NUM]
		Executes NUM instructions, where NUM is a natural number. If NUM is omitted
		then one instruction will be executed.
		The processor executes only instructions until the halt-instruction is found.

	trace-reg [REG]
		Traces the value of a register after each instruction, where REG is the name
		of that register. If REG is omitted then all registers are traced.

	untrace-reg [REG]
		Ends tracing the value of a register after each instruction, where REG is
		the name of that register. If REG is omitted then this ends tracing all
		registers.
